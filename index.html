      <p>█ January 2077 █</p>
      <p>
        By the opening days of 2077, the battle over Anchorage had been going on for over a decade. With the US annexation of Canada, the country found itself fighting a two-front war against both the Chinese and insurgent Canadians. While victory seemed to be in sight, it was evident to anyone who saw combat (and those unfortunates who lived there) that it would be a very pyrrhic one. Anchorage, and large swathes of the more hospitable parts of Alaska, had been laid to waste by eleven years of fighting. Civilian casualties had been brutally high, and what infrastructure remained was teetering on the verge of collapse, held together through desperate effort and a great deal of luck.
      </p><br />
      But still, the war ended. Survivors, and military members who chose to stay in a world that needed rebuilding, started to pick up the pieces that were left and reconstruct what had been destroyed. As the Sino-American war ground on and approached a stalemate, they focused on survival. With almost nothing left, an exhausted population figured that they didn’t have much to worry about beyond simply staying alive.
      </p><br />
      </p><br />
      <p>█ October 23, 2077 █</p>
      <p>
        To this day, no one knows if the bombs that struck Anchorage were deliberate, or simply an automated holdover from the days when the city was a sensible strategic target. It didn’t really matter, the effect was all the same. Anchorage was annihilated, and the people of southern Alaska realized that they weren’t as safe as they thought.
      </p><br />
      There were two post-bomb solutions that rose to prominence in the next weeks as people realized that the world as they knew it was over:
      </p><br />
      The first group fled north towards the Arctic. Although not the most hospitable place, it was relatively free of fallout thanks to the lack of military build-up and thus the lack of targeting by nuclear weapons. No one is entirely sure what happened to them, but nothing has been heard from the groups that went north since they left.
      </p><br />
      The second and larger mass migration headed south. Except for O’ahu, Hawaii was mostly spared from bombing and sounded like a far more hospitable place to settle than the frigid north. And so people fled, using whatever watercraft they could find: Oil tankers, fishing boats, ferries, even an old cruise ship that had been docked at Seward before China invaded Anchorage, were taken over and pointed south in what would later be called the Alaskan Evacuation. It was in most cases a miserable journey, far out in the open ocean to avoid the irradiated land of the west coast, often in boats not meant for such travel. Scores died, from radiation sickness and thirst and bad food and the illnesses that afflict any group of people crammed into tight quarters with insufficient sanitation.
      </p><br />
      But eventually, a few thousand people reached the island of Kauaʻi, and to them it seemed like they had found paradise.
      </p><br />
      </p><br />
      <p>█ January 1, 2078 █</p>
      <p>
        By the time of the Great War, the Hawaiian islands had been largely depopulated as people moved to the mainland amidst fears of China capturing the islands due to their strategic location. There were exceptions; the vast majority of the native Hawaiian population stayed, along with some others, but by 2077 the number residing through the islands had fallen to about 10% of pre-war numbers thanks to population transfers and the hazards of war.
      </p><br />
      </p><br />
      <p>█ The Present: 2178 █</p>
      <p>
        It’s been a hundred years since the Alaskan Evacuation, and things on Kaua’i have settled into a fairly steady situation. It’s believed that between 8 and 10 thousand people in total live on the island or on boats surrounding it. No one is now alive who remembers the migration, but their descendents as well as the descendents of those living on the island at the time keep the memory alive. With the hundredth anniversary having just occurred, islanders look towards the future and the long term situation.
